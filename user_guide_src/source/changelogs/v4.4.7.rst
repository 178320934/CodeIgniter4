BREAKING
********

- In previous versions, when comparing dates with ``Time::difference()``,
  unexpected results were returned if the date included a day different from 24
  hours due to Daylight Saving Time (DST). This bug has been fixed. See
  :ref:`Note in Times and Dates <time-viewing-differences>` for details.
